              <h2>Let me tell you a little about me!</h2>
              <p>I  was born in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. A small
                  city back in the day. Yet if you ask me where I'm from I would
                  say that from everywhere. I've lived in two countries, four states,
                  about six cities, and ten houses. Impressive huh? Although
                  the constant moving came with its issues, I learn to
                  adapt to unknown enviroments/situations, I met
                  people from different backgrounds, among other things. So yeah...
                  that's me in a nutshell.</p>
              <p>Now there is two things I love; Basketball and computers. I
                  grew up watching Michel Jordan and I been playing ball ever
                  since I was three years old. In the other hand both my parent
                  are software engineers so naturally computers were a given.
                  Since my height wont help me to play at the NBA I aspire to
                  become a software engineer.</p>
              <p>Which leads us to my educaiton. I was in Mexico up to
                  middle school. After that I moved to California where I got my
                  High School diploma and enrolled in a comunity college planning
                  to transfere to UCSD to get a B.S. in computer science. Sadyly
                  there was some missunderstandigs with my student visa so I had to
                  take my career goal and continue it in Mexico at El
                  Tecnologico de Monterrey where I'm a sophmore now.</p>
